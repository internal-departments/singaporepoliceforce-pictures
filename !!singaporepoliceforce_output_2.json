To all officers, he shares five key principles: what we do has value, challenges are opportunities to improve ourselves, we all have choices so make the right ones, when we don the blue, we must hold ourselves to higher standards and remember that bad days don't equal a bad life.What SAC Puvenesveran finds most impactful about the work that PNSD does is knowing that the staff at PNSD has made a positive difference to thousands of NSFs and NSmen, making each PNS officer's National Service journey a meaningful one.

Growing up, DSP Stanley witnessed firsthand how the presence of dedicated police officers could make a genuine difference in people's lives during their most vulnerable moments. DSP Stanley started as Police National Serviceman (PNSF) in 1992 and became regular in 1994 with the 'Best Trainee' award. DSP Stanley Tan is currently Officer-In-Charge (OC) Public Entertainment & Liquor Licensing Division at the Police Regulatory Department (PRD). Officers like DSP Stanley are gazetted with powers under the law to ensure that only persons who meet the fit and proper criteria may be granted approvals and licences and conversely, revoke or suspend the approvals and licences if these persons no longer meet the fit and proper criteria. DSP Stanley shares that PRD work is especially impactful as it serves as a bridge between demands we must protect the public interest whilst enabling legitimate business activities to flourish. When asked about the most memorable moment from his 33-years in service, he fondly shared that his experiences within each posting taught him something valuable. However, a juncture in his career that greatly impacted him was when he had to deal with a public order case. After the case had concluded, the young offenders returned with their parents - not in trouble, but to thank him. They said being treated fairly during the investigation helped them turn their lives around. That's when he truly understood the impact of police work goes beyond just solving cases.To young officers, DSP Stanleys advice is that everything happens for a reason!

        "caption": ": , \"I was interested in pursuing a career that was meaningful, exciting and could provide opportunities for personal development and growth,\" Insp Rafid shared, as he looks back at his 28-year career with the SPF. As a trainee at the Old Police Academy in 1996, Insp Rafid applied for a posting to the then-Police Task Force [now the Police Tactical Unit in Special Operations Command (SOC)]. After a six-month attachment to Bedok Police Division, he was posted to SOC in January 1997. Time flew by, and he is still serving in the SOC after 28 years. Insp Rafid candidly shared that he enjoyed the tactical nature of the work, but more importantly, he treasured the camaraderie that existed within the unit.Currently, Insp Rafid serves as a trainer with the SOC. Transitioning from over a decade of frontline operations work to a trainer whilst juggling his family responsibilities as a father of five, presented a major challenge in adapting to an entirely new work environment. As a trainer, he focused on developing his communication and planning abilities to effectively coach and train a diverse range of officers from various SPF units. Insp Rafid shares that despite the challenges with his new role, his colleagues and supervisors supported him and allowed him to successfully navigate this career transition.To aspiring SOC officers, Insp Rafid's advice is to never give up when faced with adversity. \"Because it doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is the number of times you get back up and become stronger from it. Learn, unlearn, and relearn in this rapidly evolving world. There will always be something new for us to learn and improve upon so that we are better prepared to achieve the mission.\"Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.
