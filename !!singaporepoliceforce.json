        "caption": "' : When Inspector (Insp) Rizduan Moktar and SC/SGT Muhammad Syahid Bin Faries received an alert about a woman in distress at Changi Beach, they knew they had to act fast. Drawing on his 24 years of experience, Insp Rizduan's instincts told him something wasn't right when they spotted a lone figure by the shore. The Changi NPC Ground Response Force officers called out to the woman, but their calls went unheeded. Then, she turned into the mounting waves.Without hesitation, both officers plunged into the choppy waters after her. Fighting against strong currents and weighted down by their uniforms, they pushed forward with a single mission - to bring her back safely.Equipment can be replaced. Lives cannot, says Insp Rizduan, who now mentors younger officers like SC/SGT Syahid at Changi NPC. For the 24-year-old PNSF officer who enlisted in October 2023, this incident proved that real-life situations demand more than just training - they require courage, quick thinking, and unwavering determination.This is the story of two officers, separated by decades of experience but united by their commitment to protect and serve.

The exercise was organised by the SPF, supported by the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Singapore Armed Forces, in close collaboration with Kallang Alive Sport Management. Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of Social and Family Development, attended as the Guest-of-Honour. With more large-scale concerts and lifestyle events held at the Singapore Sports Hub, this exercise strengthens emergency preparedness against potential terror threats in diverse urban environments. In this exercise, the SPF demonstrated how post-blast investigations are conducted, where forensic examination of improvised explosive devices (IED) fragments at a post-blast scene can provide useful investigative leads on the structure and construction of the IED. Every member of the community has a role to play in keeping Singapore safe against terrorism by remaining vigilant at all times.

As clich as it may sound, every case we handle is unique. Each accident scene presents a grim reality twisted metal, injured victims, and sometimes, lives lost. Our job is to fact-find and uncover what happened by reconstructing the events, viewing camera footages and speaking to witnesses. Not just to determine who is at fault, but also to understand if we can prevent such accidents from happening again.Beyond the technical investigations, the emotional toll on my investigation officers can be immense. They are often the ones who need to deliver the hardest news to families, telling them that their loved one isnt coming home. No amount of experience prepares you for that. Hence, I place great emphasis on the welfare and mental well-being of my officers to ensure they are well taken care of.It was clear that her care for her officers was not all talk as her office walls were adorned with named photographs of her officers, a testament to her commitment to their personal and professional growth.Adding on, Supt Cindy shared: Road safety isnt just about enforcing laws. Behaviour of the road users play a very important part. One moment of recklessness can change lives forever. So please drive responsibly, follow the laws and think about the lives around you.Before we left, we asked for her advice to young officers in the Force. Stay focused on our mission.

        "caption": ": Greeting us with a bright smile, the Head Investigation of Traffic Police (TP) Supt Cindy New, warmly welcomed us into her office at the TP Headquarters before recounting her 30-year-long career with the Singapore Police Force.Having spent more than 25 years in the investigation fraternity including her previous role as the Head Investigation of Jurong Division, we wondered what drives her every day. As clich as it may sound, every case we handle is unique. Each accident scene presents a grim reality twisted metal, injured victims, and sometimes, lives lost. Our job is to fact-find and uncover what happened by reconstructing the events, viewing camera footages and speaking to witnesses. Not just to determine who is at fault, but also to understand if we can prevent such accidents from happening again.Beyond the technical investigations, the emotional toll on my investigation officers can be immense. They are often the ones who need to deliver the hardest news to families, telling them that their loved one isnt coming home. No amount of experience prepares you for that. Hence, I place great emphasis on the welfare and mental well-being of my officers to ensure they are well taken care of.It was clear that her care for her officers was not all talk as her office walls were adorned with named photographs of her officers, a testament to her commitment to their personal and professional growth.Adding on, Supt Cindy shared: Road safety isnt just about enforcing laws. Behaviour of the road users play a very important part. One moment of recklessness can change lives forever. So please drive responsibly, follow the laws and think about the lives around you.Before we left, we asked for her advice to young officers in the Force. Stay focused on our mission. Do your best in every task you are assigned to and take charge of your career by having regular talks with your supervisors to unleash your potential.Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.Photos by Ong Lin Hui.spfveterans singaporepoliceforce safeguardingeveryday"

Everyone has a role in building our resilience against terror attacks, and maintaining vigilance at workplaces, neighbourhoods and places where we live, work and play.

SI Aniq conducted a visual scan from the exterior of the block and saw thick smoke emanating from a units kitchen window. Aniq alerted the SCDF immediately and called for back-up whilst running up the stairs to the unit to attend to the incident.Upon reaching the affected level, the common corridor was already engulfed in thick black smoke. Braving the smoke, Aniq and Fayyaz crouched down and rushed towards the unit. There, they saw an elderly man standing at the main gate, clutching his pants and t-shirt. He was trying to exit the unit, but the gate was locked and he was unsure where the key was.While SI Aniq and SGT Fayyaz were attempting to calm the man down and jog his memory on where the key was kept, SGT Tong and SC Armand arrived and assisted to quickly evacuate occupants of the neighbouring units to safety.During the engagement, the man suddenly threw two pairs of pants and a shirt out of the unit. Wasting no time, SGT Fayyaz searched the pants for the key and in a slightly burnt pants pocket, SGT Fayyaz found it. Officers quickly opened the gate and brought the man to safety. By this time, the black smoke had thickened and started to irritate the eyes of the officers. In spite of that, two officers rushed into the unit and put out the fire with an extinguisher. The man was subsequently conveyed to hospital for treatment of his burn injuries. At that moment, all we wanted to do is to save the man and evacuate his neighbours to safety. Looking back, our safety were likely at risk too because the smoke was getting thicker by the minute. But I am glad everyone was safe, including the man.

These are 3 words I would use to describe my experience in the ERT. With the nature of the job, there is no doubt that it can get challenging. Despite that, it is truly fulfilling to see my team contribute to public safety by addressing various incidents with the skills we have acquired. The rigorous regimen of physical and tactical training that being in the ERT entails is also enjoyable, as I always had a passion for activities that involve discipline and drive.

That is why I became a police officer in 1991 and why I decided to volunteer. There are people amongst us going through tough times and I hope my presence, even if momentarily, can help distract them from their pain, discomfort or problems.There is one line within the Police Pledge which says, we pledge to serve our community and our country and I think this line resonates with me.

This is not surprising, given that he has spent more than 25 years in the Division, serving 10 different commanders.Supt Lim joined the Singapore Police Force (SPF) as a Police Constable in February 1985 and began his career as a patrol team officer. He also had postings in the investigation and operation domains in his 39 years with the SPF. He has risen through the ranks over the years, and is now a Superintendent of Police, responsible for managing the finance and logistics aspects in the Division.When I first joined the SPF in the 1980s, the patrol car was pretty much just a normal car with a police logo on it. On the interior, it looks like any other car on the road. Today, our next-generation fast response car integrates technology and functional design, which greatly improves our officers operational effectiveness and safety at the frontline.Also gone were the days where we need to do photo-fit to get a rough idea of how our suspects look like! Today, our police cameras are able to provide useful leads quickly to help us solve cases.And of course, as the society progresses, actions by the police on the ground will sometimes get scrutinised by the public. It is a challenge that we have to deal with, and I always share with my officers that as long as we remain professional and stay true to our core values in every case we handle, we will be fine.(Continued in comments)"

The BST provides a realistic training environment for Police Coast Guard (PCG) officers to train their operational tactics. The BST has a 25 meters indoor firing range that is specially designed for various tactical firearms training. Thunder flashes and stun grenades can be deployed in the range to support complex training requirements. It also comes installed with a Range Management System allowing officers to remotely manage the electronic target system and simulate various lighting conditions and sound environments. The newly installed Rope Access Platform consists of fast roping beams and rappelling anchor points. This facility allows multiple personnel to descend simultaneously, providing a rapid and efficient means of insertion into a hostile vessel. This new platform will enable officers to train and practise quick and safe descent from elevated positions to a cushioned lower platform. There are also Close-Quarters Battle Areas within the BST that can accommodate both live firing and non-live firing trainings. The non-live firing area consists of single to multiple rooms setting, and the rooms are built with hidden compartments and false ceilings to train officers in vessel rummaging. The live-firing area in each deck is made up of a modular layout that allows the setup for the deck to be changed for each training session, helping to increase the realism of the training as the participants cannot predict the decks layout.

In 2003, it was renamed as the Police K-9 Unit and reorganised to be part of the newly established Special Operations Command.Today, there are more than 230 working dogs in the Police K-9 Unit, and they play key roles in various police operations, ranging from finding explosives, tracking missing persons to providing security coverage for major events."

In 2003, it was renamed as the Police K-9 Unit and reorganised to be part of the newly established Special Operations Command.Today, there are more than 230 working dogs in the Police K-9 Unit, and they play key roles in various police operations, ranging from finding explosives, tracking missing persons to providing security coverage for major events."

I know this might sound quite dramatic but I quickly dashed out of the house while telling my family members I need to go down, I need to save the girl!.It wasnt wise to confront a man with a knife alone so as I ran past some migrant workers who were working nearby, I asked if they had anything I could use to protect myself. They quickly handed me a hoe from their worksite and I ran towards the couple.Once at the carpark, I saw that a driver had stopped and used his car to block the man from reaching the woman. The man was still waving his knife and shouting incoherently.A crowd had already formed by then. For everyones safety, I knew I had to defuse the situation as soon as possible. I addressed him calmly. Im a police officer. Please drop your knife.Suddenly, he began charging towards me with his knife. Fortunately, I managed to deflect his blow by quickly swinging the hoe at him. He backed away. I saw the mans eyes darting around when he realised that there wasnt anywhere for him to run. The crowd had him surrounded. In a panic, he pointed the knife towards himself and started slashing at his own arms.I took this chance to quickly grab his wrist and disarmed him. Some nearby onlookers then rushed in and together we successfully subdued the man. Soon enough, police officers arrived and arrested him.

In the 1970s and 80s, the Police were faced with rising crime cases. To better fight crime, community-based policing strategy was introduced via the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system in 1983. The NPP system focused on leveraging community support in the areas of crime prevention and detection. In 1997, the NPP system evolved into the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) system. The NPCs serve as one-stop policing centres and bring a wider range of police services closer to the community. The Community Policing System (COPS) system was introduced in 2012 to further strengthen our partnership with the community. Under COPS, the Community Policing Unit (CPU) was formed as a full-fledged unit to take on community policing roles. Clad in their signature white polo tees and blue bermudas, CPU officers build closer relationships with the community and stakeholders through physical and online engagements. Over the years, volunteer schemes such as the Community Watch Scheme (CWS), Citizens on Patrol (COP), Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) and VSC (Community) have also been introduced to empower the community to be our Enabled Police Partners.

I enjoy the tactical trainings, I like my job, and every day brings about something new. This is probably why I like to stay active during my off-days as well. I first signed up for the MyResponder app back in 2017, which alerts members of the public to nearby emergency cases. Being a police officer, I am trained in CPR. I thought to myself - why not put these skills to good use? Thus far, Ive been activated seven times via the app to cases where someone in my vicinity needed assistance. The first time I got activated was in 2020. I was at home when the alert of a Suspected Cardiac Arrest popped up stating that someone in the neighbouring condo unit needed assistance. I quickly rushed over and sought the help of the security guard to bring me up to the unit. We found an elderly man who had collapsed between some furniture. I had to think quick on my feet. We repositioned the man and I asked the security guard to assist me with the AED as I conducted CPR. Fortunately, the paramedics soon arrived and conveyed him to the hospital. The most recent incident happened earlier in April this year. Since this wasnt my first activation, I already had a personal process set in place to ensure I was fully prepared to assist when on the scene: (i) receive the alert, (ii) check for the nearest AED then (iii) head to the location. When I arrived, a crowd of onlookers had already formed. I saw a lady attempting to do CPR on an elderly man with the assistance of an SCDF operator on the phone. I quickly took over from the lady until paramedics arrived. I then found out that the elderly mans bicycle was still at the scene. With the help of a neighbour, we returned the bicycle to his unit where we also informed his daughter on what had happened. [To be continued in comment section]"

The majority of them had no experience in organised seamanship other than experience on fishing vessels. Throughout the rest of the year, classes were organised for officers to be qualified Steersman to operate the boat and to improve the operational effectiveness of the unit.Today, all our frontline PCG officers are trained in seamanship, navigation, boat handling and weaponry, to deter and detect criminal activities out at sea.In June 2022, PCG commissioned the 5th Generation PT Class Patrol Craft with features such as the remote weapon system, waterjet propulsion for speed manoeuvrability, and improved sensors for surveillance and navigation. The addition of these new boats further enhanced PCGs crime-fighting capabilities at the frontline.policeheritage"

        "caption": "The Police Coast Guard (PCG), formerly known as the Marine Police, has come a long way from its humble beginnings to become a professional and modern unit that safeguards Singapore's territorial waters today.In 1951, 200 men were drafted to the Marine Police to operate a new fleet of boats. The majority of them had no experience in organised seamanship other than experience on fishing vessels. Throughout the rest of the year, classes were organised for officers to be qualified Steersman to operate the boat and to improve the operational effectiveness of the unit.Today, all our frontline PCG officers are trained in seamanship, navigation, boat handling and weaponry, to deter and detect criminal activities out at sea.In June 2022, PCG commissioned the 5th Generation PT Class Patrol Craft with features such as the remote weapon system, waterjet propulsion for speed manoeuvrability, and improved sensors for surveillance and navigation. The addition of these new boats further enhanced PCGs crime-fighting capabilities at the frontline.policeheritage"

My father was a TP officer too, so when he first learned that I joined, he was a little worried for my safety. I was undeterred though, because Ive always felt the need to serve in the force. It was about 9pm on 17 Nov 2017. I was out on patrol and on my way back to TP HQ. I was riding along Bedok Reservoir Road when I spotted a driver in a white Maserati car who wasnt wearing a seatbelt. I signalled for the car to stop a few times but he wasnt complying. My gut feeling told me something felt a bit off. The car only came to a stop due to the red traffic light ahead. I then parked my motorcycle ahead of his vehicle and approached the driver. The drivers window was wound down. I directed for him to reverse his vehicle nearer to the bus bay behind. However the moment the traffic lights turned green, he abruptly swerved to the right and accelerated his car. I was caught by surprise and since I was standing near the drivers window, my jacket got caught at the cars window frame. The vehicle continued to speed up with my arm still dangling from the window. Everything happened so quickly. I was dragged for about 124 meters before I managed to free myself. As I lay injured on the road, a few bystanders came to my aid. Paramedics arrived soon after. I was given 20 days medical leave for injuries to my knee, neck and back. The driver was eventually charged in court. After the incident, I did feel a bit down and wondered if I could continue to work due to my injuries. I honestly enjoy my job and would very much like to resume patrolling if I am certified fit to do so. To my relief and after taking a year to recover from my injuries, Im now back on the road. I count myself blessed to have the support from my wife and colleagues. As a traffic patrol officer, even the most routine traffic stop may result in rather unexpected outcome.

        "caption": "In this line of duty, you can expect some risks on the job. Ive been in the Traffic Police for about eight years. My father was a TP officer too, so when he first learned that I joined, he was a little worried for my safety. I was undeterred though, because Ive always felt the need to serve in the force. It was about 9pm on 17 Nov 2017. I was out on patrol and on my way back to TP HQ. I was riding along Bedok Reservoir Road when I spotted a driver in a white Maserati car who wasnt wearing a seatbelt. I signalled for the car to stop a few times but he wasnt complying. My gut feeling told me something felt a bit off. The car only came to a stop due to the red traffic light ahead. I then parked my motorcycle ahead of his vehicle and approached the driver. The drivers window was wound down. I directed for him to reverse his vehicle nearer to the bus bay behind. However the moment the traffic lights turned green, he abruptly swerved to the right and accelerated his car. I was caught by surprise and since I was standing near the drivers window, my jacket got caught at the cars window frame. The vehicle continued to speed up with my arm still dangling from the window. Everything happened so quickly. I was dragged for about 124 meters before I managed to free myself. As I lay injured on the road, a few bystanders came to my aid. Paramedics arrived soon after. I was given 20 days medical leave for injuries to my knee, neck and back. The driver was eventually charged in court. After the incident, I did feel a bit down and wondered if I could continue to work due to my injuries. I honestly enjoy my job and would very much like to resume patrolling if I am certified fit to do so. To my relief and after taking a year to recover from my injuries, Im now back on the road.

I gave a call to Grab and explained the situation to them. I also gave a call to the mans next-of-kin and assured them that hes safe and will be brought to the nearby hospital. S: Then we realised - what do we do with his bicycle and the delivery? So we kept the bicycle safely locked and left a note to ensure it wouldnt be taken away. Unfortunately, we had to dispose of the food order. The ambulance soon came. After explaining to the paramedics, we bade him a safe farewell. P: A few days later, we learned that the man had turned up at the NPC to pass us a handwritten note personally addressed to SC/CPL Xie Sibin, who had also assisted us in attending to the man that day. It was quite heartwarming. S: It was nice and Im thankful for having a good team. Though I have to say that we dont do this just because were on duty.

I think its a good thing.That day on 27 Feb 2021, my two friends and I were at the hotel swimming pool celebrating one of our birthdays. I noticed a few kids were playing at the other end of the pool with the adults. I have a young nephew at home, so I tend to be more aware when kids are involved. I then noticed at the corner of my eye something pink at the bottom of the pool. I waded closer and it only dawned on me when I saw a little girls motionless arms and legs. Without second thoughts, I dived into the pool to reach out to the girl, and one of the adults helped pull her out of the water. As the family members dialled for an ambulance, I attempted to do CPR on her. I remembered myself shaking when doing the compressions but I quickly composed myself as I had to stay absolutely focused on the task. To my relief, she eventually expelled out the water from her mouth and started breathing. The CPR compressions only lasted a minute but that moment felt like a whole millennia to me and her family members.The ambulance arrived shortly to bring the girl to the hospital. After everyone left, I decided to stay and sit on the bench near the swimming pool alone. I found myself thinking what could have happened if the girl didnt make it or if shell be okay. It was a mixture of relief and concern.When this incident was published on social media, the mother reached out to me. She expressed her thanks and said that her girl wanted to give me a token of gratitude. I appreciated the gesture but turned down her kind offer as I was just happy to hear that her daughter was safe and sound. Thats all I really needed.Im thankful for doing the things I get to do on a daily basis as an officer, to be able to make a difference in someones life with my little contributions.

All residents belonging to the particular RC/ NCs zone automatically become members of the NWZ, which works with their local Neighbourhood Police Centre to fight crime.A new community volunteer programme will be launched in December this year, and this watch group will come under the new programme.

In the aftermath of World War II, manpower was badly needed to restore law and order in Singapore. About 100 men responded to the call and joined as the first VSC officers. Since then, thousands have followed in their footsteps and the VSC stands at more than 1,200 strong today.VSC officers are vested with the powers of a police officer and contribute significantly to keeping Singapore safe.

The boatman refused to stop his boat despite repeated verbal and visual warnings through firing of flares by the PCG. PCG then swiftly intercepted the boat and arrested the 46-year-old boatman. A 20-year-old man was subsequently arrested at the fencing along the coastline of Punggol Barat.The motorized fiberglass boat and cash amounting to RM$3,734 were seized.Preliminary investigations revealed that the Malaysian boatman had picked up the Bangladeshi man from the shoreline of Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
