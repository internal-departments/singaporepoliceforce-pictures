        "caption": ": After joining SPF as an NSF in 1984 and returning as an Inspector in 1992, SAC Puvenesveran has dedicated over 36 years of service to the Force, including more than 2 decades with the Gurkha Contingent, before taking on his current role as Director of the Police National Service Department (PNSD) in 2020.When asked about a defining moment in his career, SAC Puvenesveran candidly shared that it was when he met a former offender on the street who thanked him for investigating a case that changed his life and made him a better father. \"These are the unrecognised but big positive changes that every SPF officer does every day,\" he reflects.As a leader, he believes that \"Great Leaders are not born. They are MADE by Greater Followers.\" SAC Puvenesveran values investing in officers by forming the team, training the team, and trusting the team. To all officers, he shares five key principles: what we do has value, challenges are opportunities to improve ourselves, we all have choices so make the right ones, when we don the blue, we must hold ourselves to higher standards and remember that bad days don't equal a bad life.What SAC Puvenesveran finds most impactful about the work that PNSD does is knowing that the staff at PNSD has made a positive difference to thousands of NSFs and NSmen, making each PNS officer's National Service journey a meaningful one. Beyond his role as Director PNSD, he serves as General Secretary of HomeTeamNS, working to balance the call for officers to serve, with opportunities for them and their families to connect and play.Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.Photos by Ong Lin Hui.spfveterans singaporepoliceforce safeguardingeveryday pns50"

From balancing police duties to intensive training sessions, our six officers exemplified what it means to serve Singapore both on duty and on the sporting stage.\"Representing Singapore is a tremendous honour for us,\" SSS Ithnin shared on behalf of the team. \"We are proud to wear our country's colours, showcasing our strength and teamwork to other nations.\"The journey was not without its challenges. Facing experienced opponents and pushing through injuries tested their resolve, but for our SPF officers, their police training proved invaluable. The discipline, teamwork, and ability to remain calm under pressure that defines their police work became their secret weapons in the competition arena.Together with the strong support from their teammates Taufiq and Andre, who understood the challenges of balancing shift work and training sessions, they were united and unstoppable.\"During the match, we focused on our strategy and on supporting each other. We kept reminding ourselves to stay strong and pull together as a team,\" they reflected. \"Winning bronze at the SEA Games' Mixed 560KG Tug of War is an amazing feeling for us! We are thrilled to be bringing home a medal for Singapore. It is a dream come true.\"This is what it means to serve Singapore whether keeping our communities safe or representing our nation with pride. singaporepoliceforce safeguardingeveryday pns50 TeamSingapore SEAGames2025"

I wasnt thinking about winning I just wanted to do my best for my teammate, our coaches, our sport, and our country.That mindset delivered gold. This is what it means to serve Singapore whether protecting our streets or representing our nation on the world stage. This is what it means to push through doubt, fatigue, and pressure. This is what it means to inspire the next generation of athletes who dare to dream.Nicholas credits his family and his team at PLD for their unwavering support, reminding us that behind every champion stands a community that believes.To Nicholas and Diyanah: Congratulations!

When asked about the most memorable moment from his 33-years in service, he fondly shared that his experiences within each posting taught him something valuable. However, a juncture in his career that greatly impacted him was when he had to deal with a public order case.

        "caption": ": & The trust that citizens place in us to safeguard their wellbeing is both humbling and energising. DSP Stanley shared, as he looks back at his 33-year career with the SPF. Growing up, DSP Stanley witnessed firsthand how the presence of dedicated police officers could make a genuine difference in people's lives during their most vulnerable moments. DSP Stanley started as Police National Serviceman (PNSF) in 1992 and became regular in 1994 with the 'Best Trainee' award. DSP Stanley Tan is currently Officer-In-Charge (OC) Public Entertainment & Liquor Licensing Division at the Police Regulatory Department (PRD). Officers like DSP Stanley are gazetted with powers under the law to ensure that only persons who meet the fit and proper criteria may be granted approvals and licences and conversely, revoke or suspend the approvals and licences if these persons no longer meet the fit and proper criteria. DSP Stanley shares that PRD work is especially impactful as it serves as a bridge between demands we must protect the public interest whilst enabling legitimate business activities to flourish. When asked about the most memorable moment from his 33-years in service, he fondly shared that his experiences within each posting taught him something valuable. However, a juncture in his career that greatly impacted him was when he had to deal with a public order case. After the case had concluded, the young offenders returned with their parents - not in trouble, but to thank him. They said being treated fairly during the investigation helped them turn their lives around. That's when he truly understood the impact of police work goes beyond just solving cases.To young officers, DSP Stanleys advice is that everything happens for a reason! What might initially seem like setbacks or diversions often become the experiences that shape you into a more well-rounded officer and leader. Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.

        "caption": ": , \"I was interested in pursuing a career that was meaningful, exciting and could provide opportunities for personal development and growth,\" Insp Rafid shared, as he looks back at his 28-year career with the SPF. As a trainee at the Old Police Academy in 1996, Insp Rafid applied for a posting to the then-Police Task Force [now the Police Tactical Unit in Special Operations Command (SOC)]. After a six-month attachment to Bedok Police Division, he was posted to SOC in January 1997. Time flew by, and he is still serving in the SOC after 28 years. Insp Rafid candidly shared that he enjoyed the tactical nature of the work, but more importantly, he treasured the camaraderie that existed within the unit.Currently, Insp Rafid serves as a trainer with the SOC. Transitioning from over a decade of frontline operations work to a trainer whilst juggling his family responsibilities as a father of five, presented a major challenge in adapting to an entirely new work environment. As a trainer, he focused on developing his communication and planning abilities to effectively coach and train a diverse range of officers from various SPF units. Insp Rafid shares that despite the challenges with his new role, his colleagues and supervisors supported him and allowed him to successfully navigate this career transition.To aspiring SOC officers, Insp Rafid's advice is to never give up when faced with adversity. \"Because it doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is the number of times you get back up and become stronger from it. Learn, unlearn, and relearn in this rapidly evolving world. There will always be something new for us to learn and improve upon so that we are better prepared to achieve the mission.\"Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.

As a trainee at the Old Police Academy in 1996, Insp Rafid applied for a posting to the then-Police Task Force [now the Police Tactical Unit in Special Operations Command (SOC)]. After a six-month attachment to Bedok Police Division, he was posted to SOC in January 1997. Time flew by, and he is still serving in the SOC after 28 years. Insp Rafid candidly shared that he enjoyed the tactical nature of the work, but more importantly, he treasured the camaraderie that existed within the unit.Currently, Insp Rafid serves as a trainer with the SOC. Transitioning from over a decade of frontline operations work to a trainer whilst juggling his family responsibilities as a father of five, presented a major challenge in adapting to an entirely new work environment. As a trainer, he focused on developing his communication and planning abilities to effectively coach and train a diverse range of officers from various SPF units. Insp Rafid shares that despite the challenges with his new role, his colleagues and supervisors supported him and allowed him to successfully navigate this career transition.To aspiring SOC officers, Insp Rafid's advice is to never give up when faced with adversity. \"Because it doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is the number of times you get back up and become stronger from it. Learn, unlearn, and relearn in this rapidly evolving world. There will always be something new for us to learn and improve upon so that we are better prepared to achieve the mission.\"Produced by Brenda Teo and Daenia Lim.

SMS Sim Ann presented the Total Defence Individual Advocate Awards to 3 Members of Public who have demonstrated outstanding advocacy for National Service. She also presented the Best Trainee Award to 13 graduands for excelling in both their professional studies and physical training while undergoing their basic training in the Police Training Command. These graduands are now ready to begin their next service chapter across various SPF units, putting their training into practice to keep Singapore safe and secure.

This event was special as we commemorated 50 years of PNS, with the graduands forming the number \"50\" during the parade - a fitting tribute to this significant milestone! We were honoured to have Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as our Reviewing Officer for this momentous occasion. During her speech, SMS Sim Ann urged the officers to serve their National Service with dedication, embodying the SPF core values of Courage, Loyalty, Integrity and Fairness, to fulfill the SPF mission to prevent, deter and detect crime in Singapore. SMS Sim Ann presented the Total Defence Individual Advocate Awards to 3 Members of Public who have demonstrated outstanding advocacy for National Service. She also presented the Best Trainee Award to 13 graduands for excelling in both their professional studies and physical training while undergoing their basic training in the Police Training Command. These graduands are now ready to begin their next service chapter across various SPF units, putting their training into practice to keep Singapore safe and secure. Their continued commitment in protecting our nation and serving our community continues the proud legacy of five decades of PNS. Our heartiest congratulations to all graduands!singaporepoliceforce NS50"

        "caption": "- On 10 October 2025, the Singapore Police Force held a graduation parade for 443 Full-time Police National Service (PNS) officers from the 200th Intake. This event was special as we commemorated 50 years of PNS, with the graduands forming the number \"50\" during the parade - a fitting tribute to this significant milestone! We were honoured to have Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as our Reviewing Officer for this momentous occasion. During her speech, SMS Sim Ann urged the officers to serve their National Service with dedication, embodying the SPF core values of Courage, Loyalty, Integrity and Fairness, to fulfill the SPF mission to prevent, deter and detect crime in Singapore. SMS Sim Ann presented the Total Defence Individual Advocate Awards to 3 Members of Public who have demonstrated outstanding advocacy for National Service. She also presented the Best Trainee Award to 13 graduands for excelling in both their professional studies and physical training while undergoing their basic training in the Police Training Command. These graduands are now ready to begin their next service chapter across various SPF units, putting their training into practice to keep Singapore safe and secure. Their continued commitment in protecting our nation and serving our community continues the proud legacy of five decades of PNS. Our heartiest congratulations to all graduands!singaporepoliceforce NS50"
