The commitment remained. Police officers carry up to 5kg of essential equipment including firearms, a Taser, a straight extendable baton, communications devices and handcuffs on their utility belts to support their duties. The currently on trial new Load Bearing Vest (LBV) is designed to improve officers' operational efficiency and endurance, equipment capacity, and overall efficiency. It redistributes the equipment weight from the utility belt to the upper body, with handcuffs and communication devices attached directly to the vest. This reduces lower back strain and enhances officers' comfort during their extended shift duties. Read more about it in our Police Life article.\n"}]}]}}

As he made calls to support the investigation, he watched officers from different units work seamlessly together. When the case was successfully resolved, the collective sense of relief and accomplishment was unmistakable. It was an all-hands-on-deck moment that would spark a lifelong commitment to service. Today, as the NS Commander of the Airport Police Division (APD), he leads 1,300 Police National Service (PNS) officers. Looking back on his time with the Singapore Police Force, he reflects on a journey that has taken him from the gritty undercover operations of the now-defunct Charlie Division, through critical roles in CID, to his current command at APD, a path that has continued to shape his approach to leadership and service. He believes that as a responsible member of a community, one should contribute beyond taking care of oneself and one's family. Being an active PNSman is one small way to contribute. His service forged more than skills; it shaped a career spanning nearly two decades in aviation security and instilled values that now guide him as Deputy Director of Airport Operations and Aviation Security at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The professionalism and skill of CID officers set a high standard for what excellence means, he reflects. It showed a 19-year-old PNSF how dedication and expertise drive an organisation forward.

The Deputy Superintendent (DSP) shared, as he looks back at his 33-year career with the Singapore Police Force (SPF). Growing up, he witnessed firsthand how the presence of dedicated police officers could make a genuine difference in people's lives during their most vulnerable moments. He started as a Police National Serviceman (PNSF) in 1992 and became regular in 1994 with the 'Best Trainee' award. Currently, he serves as Officer-In-Charge (OC) Public Entertainment & Liquor Licensing Division at the Police Regulatory Department (PRD). Officers like him are gazetted with powers under the law to ensure that only persons who meet the fit and proper criteria may be granted approvals and licences, and conversely, revoke or suspend the approvals and licences if these persons no longer meet the fit and proper criteria. He shares that PRD work is especially impactful as it serves as a bridge between demands to protect the public interest whilst enabling legitimate business activities to flourish. When asked about the most memorable moment from his 33 years in service, he fondly shared that his experiences within each posting taught him something valuable. However, a juncture in his career that greatly impacted him was when he had to deal with a public order case. After the case had concluded, the young offenders returned with their parents - not in trouble, but to thank him. They said being treated fairly during the investigation helped them turn their lives around. That's when he truly understood the impact of police work goes beyond just solving cases. To young officers, his advice is that everything happens for a reason! What might initially seem like setbacks or diversions often become the experiences that shape you into a more well-rounded officer and leader. Produced by the team. Photos by the team.\n"}]}]}}

As a trainee at the Old Police Academy in 1996, he applied for a posting to the then-Police Task Force [now the Police Tactical Unit in Special Operations Command (SOC)]. After a six-month attachment to Bedok Police Division, he was posted to SOC in January 1997. Time flew by, and he is still serving in the SOC after 28 years. Insp Rafid candidly shared that he enjoyed the tactical nature of the work, but more importantly, he treasured the camaraderie that existed within the unit. Currently, he serves as a trainer with the SOC. Transitioning from over a decade of frontline operations work to a trainer whilst juggling family responsibilities as a father of five, presented a major challenge in adapting to an entirely new work environment. As a trainer, he focused on developing his communication and planning abilities to effectively coach and train a diverse range of officers from various SPF units. Insp Rafid shares that despite the challenges with his new role, his colleagues and supervisors supported him and allowed him to successfully navigate this career transition. To aspiring SOC officers, Insp Rafid's advice is to never give up when faced with adversity. \"Because it doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is the number of times you get back up and become stronger from it. Learn, unlearn, and relearn in this rapidly evolving world. There will always be something new for us to learn and improve upon so that we are better prepared to achieve the mission.\"\n"}]}]}}

We were honoured to have a Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs as our Reviewing Officer for this momentous occasion. During her speech, she urged the officers to serve their National Service with dedication, embodying the SPF core values of Courage, Loyalty, Integrity and Fairness, to fulfill the SPF mission to prevent, deter and detect crime in Singapore. She presented the Total Defence Individual Advocate Awards to 3 Members of Public who have demonstrated outstanding advocacy for National Service. She also presented the Best Trainee Award to 13 graduands for excelling in both their professional studies and physical training while undergoing their basic training in the Police Training Command. These graduands are now ready to begin their next service chapter across various SPF units, putting their training into practice to keep Singapore safe and secure.

Growing up drawn to Crimewatch and police dramas, her passion for law enforcement grew during her National Police Cadet Corps years in secondary school and university. Her desire to serve the community pushed her to join the SPF after graduation. Currently, AC is Deputy Director of the SPF's Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) Office set up in February 2024 to tackle online criminal harms. The OCHA Office works with online service providers and government agencies to safeguard users from online crimes. In her SPF career, AC assisted in post-disaster efforts after the 2004 tsunami as Family Liaison Officer to next-of-kins of missing Singaporeans, reviewed policies after the 2013 Little India Riot, worked on frontline resource allocation during the 2015 SEA Games and oversaw operations at the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) during the 2018 Trump-Kim Summit. As the first female full-time SPF Aide-De-Camp (ADC), she accompanied the President to state functions locally and overseas, including National Day Parade and Cabinet ceremonies. She was Family Liaison Officer during the President's lying-in-state in 2016, having served as his ADC from 2010 to 2011. Other highlights include a secondment to MHA as Deputy Director and Deputy Commander of Tanglin Division. As a Police Women's Committee member, AC credits women's progress to determined policewomen who challenged traditional roles. She organises career support through town halls and advocates for enhancing female officers' participation and improving support for working mothers. AC also leads the Police Sports Association Netball team, which emerged as Champion at the recent Public Service Netball Tournament! Her advice: \"Approach every new role with an open mind when opportunity arises, stay positive and always be ready to learn - you never know what you might discover about yourself.\"\n"}]}]}}

Currently, he is the Head of Operations at Clementi Police Division. Throughout his career, his frontline experience includes working as a patrol officer, managing lock-up operations, conducting investigations, and leading a Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) as Commanding Officer. He had also served as a planning officer and Head of Operational Logistics at the Police Logistics Department. SUPT Rimyzad is also part of the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) - a specialised group of officers who are trained to stay calm in chaos, stepping in with negotiation and communication tactics to save lives during crisis situations such as suicide attempts and hostage incidents. In his role as CNU Team Coordinator, he supports the Ground Commander to ensure a successful resolution to the operation. Drawing from the 23 years of experience in CNU, each crisis intervention has deeply impacted SUPT Rimyzad, with every successful rescue strengthening his commitment to the unit.
