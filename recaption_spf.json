Thunder flashes and stun grenades can be deployed in the range to support complex training requirements. It also comes installed with a Range Management System allowing officers to remotely manage the electronic target system and simulate various lighting conditions and sound environments. The newly installed Rope Access Platform consists of fast roping beams and rappelling anchor points. This facility allows multiple personnel to descend simultaneously, providing a rapid and efficient means of insertion into a hostile vessel. This new platform will enable officers to train and practise quick and safe descent from elevated positions to a cushioned lower platform.

The non-live firing area consists of single to multiple rooms setting, and the rooms are built with hidden compartments and false ceilings to train officers in vessel rummaging.
