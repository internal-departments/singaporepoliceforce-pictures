        "caption": ": , Meet ASP Molly, a dedicated police officer who has spent 33 years serving with unwavering commitment in the Singapore Police Force, in various units such as Commercial Crime Team, First Responder Training Unit and the Community Policing Unit. For her, it all started with a desire to break free from the desk-bound routine and embrace a career on the move. Over the years, she has been inspired by the diverse experiences, the adrenaline, and the ever-evolving nature of policing.ASP Molly has witnessed incredible changesfrom cutting-edge technology enhancing crime prevention and investigation, to the establishment of specialized counter-terrorism teams. One of her most meaningful contributions was being part of the team that set up the Tactical Training Unit in the Police Training Commandequipping officers across all ranks with the tactical skills needed to respond to public security threats.Outside of work, she finds motivation in reading, jogging, and spending time with her community.

Having spent more than 25 years in the investigation fraternity including her previous role as the Head Investigation of Jurong Division, we wondered what drives her every day. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound, every case we handle is unique. Each accident scene presents a grim reality: twisted metal, injured victims, and sometimes, lives lost. Our job is to fact-find and uncover what happened by reconstructing the events, viewing camera footages, and speaking to witnesses. Not just to determine who is at fault, but also to understand if we can prevent such accidents from happening again. Beyond the technical investigations, the emotional toll on my investigation officers can be immense. They are often the ones who need to deliver the hardest news to families, telling them that their loved one isn't coming home. No amount of experience prepares you for that. Hence, I place great emphasis on the welfare and mental well-being of my officers to ensure they are well taken care of. It was clear that her care for her officers was not all talk as her office walls were adorned with named photographs of her officers, a testament to her commitment to their personal and professional growth. Adding on, she shared: Road safety isn't just about enforcing laws. Behaviour of the road users plays a very important part. One moment of recklessness can change lives forever.

Wasting no time, SGT Fayyaz searched the pants for the key and in a slightly burnt pants pocket, SGT Fayyaz found it. Officers quickly opened the gate and brought the man to safety.

SI Aniq conducted a visual scan from the exterior of the block and saw thick smoke emanating from a units kitchen window. Aniq alerted the SCDF immediately and called for back-up whilst running up the stairs to the unit to attend to the incident.Upon reaching the affected level, the common corridor was already engulfed in thick black smoke. Braving the smoke, Aniq and Fayyaz crouched down and rushed towards the unit. There, they saw an elderly man standing at the main gate, clutching his pants and t-shirt. He was trying to exit the unit, but the gate was locked and he was unsure where the key was.While SI Aniq and SGT Fayyaz were attempting to calm the man down and jog his memory on where the key was kept, SGT Tong and SC Armand arrived and assisted to quickly evacuate occupants of the neighbouring units to safety.During the engagement, the man suddenly threw two pairs of pants and a shirt out of the unit. Wasting no time, SGT Fayyaz searched the pants for the key and in a slightly burnt pants pocket, SGT Fayyaz found it. Officers quickly opened the gate and brought the man to safety. By this time, the black smoke had thickened and started to irritate the eyes of the officers. In spite of that, two officers rushed into the unit and put out the fire with an extinguisher. The man was subsequently conveyed to hospital for treatment of his burn injuries. At that moment, all we wanted to do is to save the man and evacuate his neighbours to safety. Looking back, our safety were likely at risk too because the smoke was getting thicker by the minute. But I am glad everyone was safe, including the man. If I had a choice, I would still have stuck with my decision to stay put to save a life, said SI Aniq.singaporepoliceforce safeguardingeveryday",

These are 3 words I would use to describe my experience in the ERT. With the nature of the job, there is no doubt that it can get challenging. Despite that, it is truly fulfilling to see my team contribute to public safety by addressing various incidents with the skills we have acquired.

He also visits nursing homes to entertain and interact with the residents, helping to keep their spirits high.I have always had a strong passion for helping people, especially the weak and the vulnerable. That is why I became a police officer in 1991 and why I decided to volunteer. There are people amongst us going through tough times and I hope my presence, even if momentarily, can help distract them from their pain, discomfort or problems.There is one line within the Police Pledge which says, we pledge to serve our community and our country and I think this line resonates with me.

Second, to continue to invest in technology, so that the SPF can keep up with the latest threats, and deal with them effectively. Today, the public's trust in the SPF remains high. The SPF has also invested heavily in technology, and developed new capabilities. From expanding Police camera coverage and analytics, and harnessing unmanned systems as well as countering threats from them, to the use of artificial intelligence to fight scams, the SPF has been pushing technological boundaries. This has enabled our lean Force to keep crime rates low, solve crime swiftly, and hence secure the trust and confidence of Singaporeans. The Parliamentary Motion to commemorate SPF200 in 2021 was a significant milestone for the SPF. We thank the Prime Minister and the Parliament of Singapore for recognising the SPF as a world-class agency and SPF officers' contributions in safeguarding Singapore. The SPF would like to thank the Prime Minister for the trust and support that has been given to the SPF. The SPF will continue to strive for the highest level of operational excellence and professionalism by upholding our core values of Courage, Loyalty, Integrity, and Fairness.

As school dismissals are usually in the early afternoon, Alif sensed that something was amiss, and he decided to approach the boy. The boy shared that he had lost his way and could not find the way home.SI Alif noticed that the boy had a phone with him, but the battery was flat. He offered to charge his phone so that the boy could contact his family. In the meantime, he bought food and drinks for the boy as he did not have any food since early afternoon. After SI Alif successfully turned the boys phone on, he noticed that there were more than 5 missed calls from various numbers. Immediately, he contacted one of the numbers, which belonged to the boys grandfather.Over the phone, the boys grandfather told SI Alif that they had been looking for him for the past few hours and they were very worried. SI Alif then informed the boys grandfather that he is a police officer and that he approached the boy as he sensed that something was off. SI Alif waited with the boy until his family reunited with him at the void deck.After the incident, one of the boys family members wrote to the Police to compliment SI Alif, I dont know how to thank the officer.. He even buy food and offer care until my daughter came to fetch my grandson. I would like to recommend this officer for his good Samaritans deed..As a parent, I can understand how the boys family felt when they could not reach him for hours. I am happy to be able to do a small part to help to reunite the boy with his family, said SI Alif. singaporepoliceforce safeguardingeveryday",

The boy shared that he had lost his way and could not find the way home.SI Alif noticed that the boy had a phone with him, but the battery was flat. He offered to charge his phone so that the boy could contact his family. In the meantime, he bought food and drinks for the boy as he did not have any food since early afternoon. After SI Alif successfully turned the boys phone on, he noticed that there were more than 5 missed calls from various numbers. Immediately, he contacted one of the numbers, which belonged to the boys grandfather.Over the phone, the boys grandfather told SI Alif that they had been looking for him for the past few hours and they were very worried. SI Alif then informed the boys grandfather that he is a police officer and that he approached the boy as he sensed that something was off. SI Alif waited with the boy until his family reunited with him at the void deck.After the incident, one of the boys family members wrote to the Police to compliment SI Alif, I dont know how to thank the officer..

We saw the front engine of a recycling truck had caught fire. Instead of running away, he bravely ran towards the fire, putting out the fire together with onlookers. No one was harmed, and no other properties were damaged. DAC (V) Koo was awarded the Community First Responder Award by the SCDF in June, 2023 for his brave acts.As a VSC (Volunteer Special Constabulary)officer, sometimes you ask yourself whether you are in this for the job or for the mission.

The BST provides a realistic training environment for Police Coast Guard (PCG) officers to train their operational tactics. The BST has a 25 meters indoor firing range that is specially designed for various tactical firearms training. Thunder flashes and stun grenades can be deployed in the range to support complex training requirements. It also comes installed with a Range Management System allowing officers to remotely manage the electronic target system and simulate various lighting conditions and sound environments. The newly installed Rope Access Platform consists of fast roping beams and rappelling anchor points. This facility allows multiple personnel to descend simultaneously, providing a rapid and efficient means of insertion into a hostile vessel. This new platform will enable officers to train and practise quick and safe descent from elevated positions to a cushioned lower platform. There are also Close-Quarters Battle Areas within the BST that can accommodate both live firing and non-live firing trainings. The non-live firing area consists of single to multiple rooms setting, and the rooms are built with hidden compartments and false ceilings to train officers in vessel rummaging. The live-firing area in each deck is made up of a modular layout that allows the setup for the deck to be changed for each training session, helping to increase the realism of the training as the participants cannot predict the decks layout. The BST enhances the training of PCG officers to ensure they are operationally ready to safeguard Singapores territorial waters every day. singaporepoliceforcesafeguardingeveryday",

        "cleaned_caption": "Constructed in 2006, the Boarding and Search Trainer (BST) is purpose-built and designed to resemble a merchant cargo vessel. The BST provides a realistic training environment for Police Coast Guard (PCG) officers to train their operational tactics. The BST has a 25 meters indoor firing range that is specially designed for various tactical firearms training. Thunder flashes and stun grenades can be deployed in the range to support complex training requirements. It also comes installed with a Range Management System allowing officers to remotely manage the electronic target system and simulate various lighting conditions and sound environments. The newly installed Rope Access Platform consists of fast roping beams and rappelling anchor points. This facility allows multiple personnel to descend simultaneously, providing a rapid and efficient means of insertion into a hostile vessel. This new platform will enable officers to train and practise quick and safe descent from elevated positions to a cushioned lower platform. There are also Close-Quarters Battle Areas within the BST that can accommodate both live firing and non-live firing trainings. The non-live firing area consists of single to multiple rooms setting, and the rooms are built with hidden compartments and false ceilings to train officers in vessel rummaging. The live-firing area in each deck is made up of a modular layout that allows the setup for the deck to be changed for each training session, helping to increase the realism of the training as the participants cannot predict the decks layout. The BST enhances the training of PCG officers to ensure they are operationally ready to safeguard Singapore's territorial waters every day."

In the 1970s and 80s, the Police were faced with rising crime cases. To better fight crime, community-based policing strategy was introduced via the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system in 1983. The NPP system focused on leveraging community support in the areas of crime prevention and detection. In 1997, the NPP system evolved into the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) system. The NPCs serve as one-stop policing centres and bring a wider range of police services closer to the community. The Community Policing System (COPS) system was introduced in 2012 to further strengthen our partnership with the community. Under COPS, the Community Policing Unit (CPU) was formed as a full-fledged unit to take on community policing roles. Clad in their signature white polo tees and blue bermudas, CPU officers build closer relationships with the community and stakeholders through physical and online engagements. Over the years, volunteer schemes such as the Community Watch Scheme (CWS), Citizens on Patrol (COP), Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) and VSC (Community) have also been introduced to empower the community to be our Enabled Police Partners. These volunteers play an important role in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Interested in partnering with us? Join us as a volunteer (link in bio).",

I enjoy the tactical trainings, I like my job, and every day brings about something new. This is probably why I like to stay active during my off-days as well. I first signed up for the MyResponder app back in 2017, which alerts members of the public to nearby emergency cases. Being a police officer, I am trained in CPR. I thought to myself - why not put these skills to good use? Thus far, Ive been activated seven times via the app to cases where someone in my vicinity needed assistance. The first time I got activated was in 2020. I was at home when the alert of a Suspected Cardiac Arrest popped up stating that someone in the neighbouring condo unit needed assistance. I quickly rushed over and sought the help of the security guard to bring me up to the unit. We found an elderly man who had collapsed between some furniture. I had to think quick on my feet. We repositioned the man and I asked the security guard to assist me with the AED as I conducted CPR. Fortunately, the paramedics soon arrived and conveyed him to the hospital. The most recent incident happened earlier in April this year. Since this wasnt my first activation, I already had a personal process set in place to ensure I was fully prepared to assist when on the scene: (i) receive the alert, (ii) check for the nearest AED then (iii) head to the location. When I arrived, a crowd of onlookers had already formed. I saw a lady attempting to do CPR on an elderly man with the assistance of an SCDF operator on the phone. I quickly took over from the lady until paramedics arrived. I then found out that the elderly mans bicycle was still at the scene. With the help of a neighbour, we returned the bicycle to his unit where we also informed his daughter on what had happened. [To be continued in comment section]",

In 2020, the SPF rolled out the Next-generation Fast Response Car.Two key features of these cars include the Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system and the In-Vehicle Video Recording System (IVVRS).The ANPR system detects vehicle of interest on the move, without officers having to divert their attention from other ongoing tasks while the IVVRS provides live streaming of high-resolution video footage to the Police Operations Command Centre that allows for better sense-making and incident management. policeheritage",

Two key features of these cars include the Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system and the In-Vehicle Video Recording System (IVVRS). The ANPR system detects vehicles of interest on the move, without officers having to divert their attention from other ongoing tasks while the IVVRS provides live streaming of high-resolution video footage to the Police Operations Command Centre that allows for better sense-making and incident management."

He shares with us his perspectives playing both roles: Being an NS leader is very much like being a father. I lead by example, set the right tone and set the right processes. This isn't very much different from being a father at home to my children. I have a 4-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. I'm always the happiest when spending time with them and making them laugh. But I do treat my NSmen like family, and I make sure I do my best to interact with every single one of them and know them personally. Some of them just want to be recognised, and being recognised by their supervisor gives them a lot of pride, so they feel very accomplished when they come back for reservist duties at ProCom. I have always approached the roles of being a father and an NS leader with the same positive attitude and enthusiasm, so I don't find it a problem to juggle both roles. In fact, my children get very excited whenever they see me in uniform!When asked on what makes him proud, DSP Paul said: Seeing my children grow up with the right values and attitudes, thinking on their feet and respecting people around them. This is very much like leading an NS division as well - when officers improve and show that they are motivated and know what to do in challenging situations, that makes me proud that I am working with such capable officers in ProCom. DSP Paul has some final words as advice: Treasure your wives and partners! They will be the ones holding the fort at home when you're on duty. Give them a nice treat whenever you can and they will appreciate it.Happy Father's Day to all the amazing and dedicated fathers out there! HappyFathersDayNS55singaporepoliceforce",

My father was a TP officer too, so when he first learned that I joined, he was a little worried for my safety. I was undeterred though, because Ive always felt the need to serve in the force. It was about 9pm on 17 Nov 2017. I was out on patrol and on my way back to TP HQ. I was riding along Bedok Reservoir Road when I spotted a driver in a white Maserati car who wasnt wearing a seatbelt. I signalled for the car to stop a few times but he wasnt complying. My gut feeling told me something felt a bit off. The car only came to a stop due to the red traffic light ahead. I then parked my motorcycle ahead of his vehicle and approached the driver. The drivers window was wound down. I directed for him to reverse his vehicle nearer to the bus bay behind. However the moment the traffic lights turned green, he abruptly swerved to the right and accelerated his car. I was caught by surprise and since I was standing near the drivers window, my jacket got caught at the cars window frame. The vehicle continued to speed up with my arm still dangling from the window. Everything happened so quickly. I was dragged for about 124 meters before I managed to free myself. As I lay injured on the road, a few bystanders came to my aid. Paramedics arrived soon after. I was given 20 days medical leave for injuries to my knee, neck and back. The driver was eventually charged in court. After the incident, I did feel a bit down and wondered if I could continue to work due to my injuries. I honestly enjoy my job and would very much like to resume patrolling if I am certified fit to do so. To my relief and after taking a year to recover from my injuries, Im now back on the road.

I think its a good thing.That day on 27 Feb 2021, my two friends and I were at the hotel swimming pool celebrating one of our birthdays. I noticed a few kids were playing at the other end of the pool with the adults. I have a young nephew at home, so I tend to be more aware when kids are involved. I then noticed at the corner of my eye something pink at the bottom of the pool. I waded closer and it only dawned on me when I saw a little girls motionless arms and legs. Without second thoughts, I dived into the pool to reach out to the girl, and one of the adults helped pull her out of the water. As the family members dialled for an ambulance, I attempted to do CPR on her. I remembered myself shaking when doing the compressions but I quickly composed myself as I had to stay absolutely focused on the task. To my relief, she eventually expelled out the water from her mouth and started breathing. The CPR compressions only lasted a minute but that moment felt like a whole millennia to me and her family members.The ambulance arrived shortly to bring the girl to the hospital. After everyone left, I decided to stay and sit on the bench near the swimming pool alone. I found myself thinking what could have happened if the girl didnt make it or if shell be okay. It was a mixture of relief and concern.When this incident was published on social media, the mother reached out to me. She expressed her thanks and said that her girl wanted to give me a token of gratitude. I appreciated the gesture but turned down her kind offer as I was just happy to hear that her daughter was safe and sound. Thats all I really needed.Im thankful for doing the things I get to do on a daily basis as an officer, to be able to make a difference in someones life with my little contributions.

From July 2021, the SPF and HTX (Home Team Science and Technology Agency) will trial customised prototypes of the MTTT with SPF frontline units for a 3-month period. Should the trial be successful, frontline officers can look forward to the implementation of MTTT for training in the future. PoliceWPS2021SmarterPolicingEmpoweredCommunity"

Not all dog breeds are suited for police work, and they are carefully selected and trained for tasks ranging from tracking criminals to detecting explosives. The first police dog in the SPF was a German Shepherd, who was brought over from the UK in 1955 to form the nucleus of the K9 Unit.

But no, I held it back as I am now on a mission with my dog handler, Station Inspector (SI) Yap Hong Lee. We are patrolling hand and paw together to protect the 33rd ASEAN Summit against public security and public order threats. SI Yap has been my handler since I joined the Force. Theres an indescribable bond between us as we have weathered uncountable days of rain and shine together. This may be my last major security deployment, but once a police dog, always a police dog! I will always remember my patrol moments with SI Yap. He is the best handler that a dog could have. For now, it is back to my duty to support my handler in his mission to safeguard the summit! Woof!
